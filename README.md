# React-Redux State Management with Jest

This is a simple React application that integrates **Redux** for state management and utilizes **Jest** for testing reducers. The app features a basic counter where users can increment and decrement the value.

## Project Overview

- **Redux** is used to manage all shared application state.
- **Reducers** are implemented as pure functions to handle state changes.
- **Jest** is used to test the functionality of the reducers.
- **Actions** are dispatched to modify the storeâ€™s state, ensuring predictable updates.
- The app is designed with a clean, polished interface for smooth user experience.
